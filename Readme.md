## Validation: 
The following message was issued when validation of the code: 
Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed.

From line 26, column 5; to line 26, column 13

ader>↩    <section>↩ 



# Decision on Validation

As no heading was needed under the main H1 header I wasn't sure if one was needed at all so I left it the way it was.
